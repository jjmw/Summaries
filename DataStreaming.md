Data streaming is optimal for time series and detecting patterns over time.
Things like traffic sensors, health sensors, transaction logs, and activity logs are all good candidates for data streaming.

## Data Streaming Challenges
- Plan for scalability.
- Plan for data durability.
- Incorporate fault tolerance in both the storage and processing layers.
